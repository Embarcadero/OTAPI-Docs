# OTAPI-Docs
## A collaborative project to expand the RAD Studio IDE Open Tools API documentation

Currently participation in this project is by invitation only.  The work is being undertaken by a group of Embarcadero MVPs and, while it is sanctioned by Embarcadero, is an *independent* project.

Anyone can raise questions or notify us of problems by raising an issue here: [https://github.com/Embarcadero/OTAPI-Docs/issues](https://github.com/Embarcadero/OTAPI-Docs/issues)

A [wiki](https://github.com/Embarcadero/OTAPI-Docs/wiki) has been added.
