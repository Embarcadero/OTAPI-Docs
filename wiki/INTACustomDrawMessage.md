## Description
INTACustomDrawMessage is an interface for a custom-drawn message.

If you want to add a custom-drawn message to the message view, then write a class that implements the INTACustomDrawMessage interface (and its ancestor interfaces), and use an instance of that class to add a custom-drawn message to the message view. 

If you do not need to custom draw the message, you can use the base interface, [IOTACustomMessage](IOTACustomMessage) instead of INTACustomDrawMessage.

You can derive your interface from [INTACustomDrawMessage](INTACustomDrawMessage) and [IOTACustomMessage50](IOTACustomMessage50) to custom-draw messages in a hierarchy.

An expert must ensure that all of its custom messages are cleared when the expert is destroyed.

As with any other INTAâ€¦ interface, you can use INTACustomDrawMessage only in an expert that uses packages (either by being installed in a package or by being installed in a DLL that uses runtime packages).

## Methods
| Method | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CalcRect | CalcRect computes the bounding box required by the entire message. The message view itself always displays messages in a single line of a fixed size. If the user hovers the cursor over a long message, a tooltip displays the entire message. CalcRect returns the size of the tooltip window. |
| Draw | Draw draws the message in the message view window or in a tooltip window. |
