## Description

INTAComponent is a native interface for a component. Cast an IOTAComponent interface to INTAComponent using the [Supports](http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/Libraries/en/System.SysUtils.Supports) function, or the [as](http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Class_References#The_as_Operator) keyword.

A native component interface lets an expert gain access to the actual TComponent or TPersistent pointer. The actual pointer value is needed if you want to modify the value of a class-type property. As with any other INTAâ€¦ interface, you can use INTAServices only in an expert that uses packages (either by being installed in a package or by being installed in a DLL that uses runtime packages).
