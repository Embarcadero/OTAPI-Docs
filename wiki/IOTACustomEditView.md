## Methods
| Method | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SameView | Returns true if this interface instance is connected to the same underlying view as the indicated instance.  You must use this method in order to test for equality between views since several interface instances may share a single view.  You should also not hold onto these view interfaces for any length of time, unless a notifier is registered with the [IOTASourceEditor](IOTASourceEditor) so you can determine when the underlying implementation is vanishing. |
